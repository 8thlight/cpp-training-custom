Inheritance / Polymorphism
--------------------------

Inheritance - parent/child relationships
Polymorphism - allows routines to use variables of different
               through a common interface

Both of these concepts are important in OO design.

In this section we will look at how these are implemented
in C++.

Start by looking at the example code in inheritance.cpp

Next move onto to polymorphism.cpp. Note that in starting state
there is a deliberate bug in the code! If you look at the output
from this you will see something looks a little weird. Can you
guess what is going on?

Finally pure_virtual.cpp gives examples of interfaces and abstract classes
