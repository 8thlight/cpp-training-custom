Inheritance / Polymorphism
--------------------------

Inheritance - sharing Code through parent/child relationships
Polymorphism - allows routines to use variables of different
               through a common interface

Both of these concepts are important in OO design.

In this section we will look at how these are implemented
in C++.

Start by looking at the example code in inheritance.cpp

Next move onto to polymorphism.cpp

Exercise: write classes in Animal.hpp / Animal.cpp to make
          test in animal_test.cpp pass
