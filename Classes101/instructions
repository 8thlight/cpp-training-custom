In this exercise we will look at the basic syntax
of classes in C++

Start by looking at basic_class.cpp to get an idea
of basic syntax.

Exercise time. Bowling.cpp contains an initial test
for a class that scores a game of bowling. It should
have two methods:

- 'roll' for number of pins knocked down in single roll
- 'score' to give final score once all rolls are made

Tasks

 1) Define the Game class in Game.hpp/Game.cpp so first test passes
 2) Implement a second test for a round where all rolls are 1

If you finish those have a think about other scores (spares/strikes)
and try implementing tests/code to handle.
