Exercise time. GameTest.cpp contains an initial test
for a class that scores a game of bowling. It should
have two methods:

- 'roll' for number of pins knocked down in single roll
- 'score' to give final score once all rolls are made


Tasks
-----

 1) Define the Game class in Game.hpp/Game.cpp so first test passes
    NOTE: you will need to add Game.cpp to compilation in cyber-dojo.sh
 2) Implement a second test for a round where all rolls are 1

If you finish those have a think about other scores (spares/strikes)
and try implementing tests/code to handle.


Scoring
-------

Scoring works as follows:

- There are 10 frames with 2 rolls in each frame

- A player gets a 'spare' when the rolls in a frame == 10
  - The bonus for a spare is equal to the roll after the spare
  - e.g. First 4 rolls 5,5,3,4 would score (5+5+3)  +  (3+4)  = 20
                                           -------     -----
                                              |          |
                                  --------------        -------
                                  frame 1 + spare       frame 2


- A player gets a strike when the first roll in a frame is a 10
  - The bonus for a strike is equal to the next two rolls
  - e.g. First 4 rolls 10,3,4,1,2 would score (10+3+4) + (3+4)  + (1+2)  = 27
                                              -------    -----    -----
                                                 |         |        |
                                  ----------------      ------     ------
                                  frame 1 + strike      frame 2    frame 3


- In the 10th frame if a spare or strike is scored then the player gets the
  extra rolls required for the bonus i.e. the 10th frame could have 3 rolls
