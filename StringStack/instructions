Exercise time.

Your task will be to write a class to represent a stack
of std::string objects by using std::vector to store
elements.

A stack is a last-in-first-out data structure that typically
implements methods push and pop to add/remove elements.

Task:
Create files Stack.hpp & Stack.cpp and implement a Stack class
that satisfies the test in StackTest.cpp. You will need to
implement the following methods

- a constructor with intializer_list (hint: have a look at
  the constructors for std::vector)
- 'size' returning number of elements in stack
- 'empty' returning whether or not stack is empty
- 'push' to add a string to stack
- 'pop' to retrieve and remove string from stack
- 'peek' to retrieve string from stack

Tip: remember to add your Stack.cpp in cyber-dojo.sh
