In this exercise we will look at the basic syntax
of vectors and maps in C++

Start by looking at basic_vectors.cpp and basic_maps.cpp
to get an idea of basic syntax.

Exercise time. The Romans wrote numbers using letters : I, V, X, L, C, D, M.
They never discovered the number zero.

For example:

    1 --> I
    10 --> X
    7 --> VII
    etc.

For a full description of how Roman Numerals work, take a look at http://www.novaroma.org/via_romana/numbers.html

RomanNumeralsTest.cpp contains an initial test
for a class that converts Arabic numbers to Roman Numerals. It should
have one public method:

- 'convert' a given Arabic number into the corresponding Roman Numeral.

Task

Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals.
There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than 3000.

If you finish, write a converter which takes a Roman Numeral and converts it into the corresponding Arabic number.
