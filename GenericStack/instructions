Exercise time.

We are going to revisit our Stack class.

Stack.hpp and Stack.cpp have a completed version of
the previous exercise. StackTest is the same as before
except a <std::string> template parameter has been added.

Your task is to convert Stack into a generic class that
can be used for any type.

Tip: you can see the previous template examples at link in slide
