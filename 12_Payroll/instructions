It's time to tackle a larger exercise, bringing together several aspects of
what we have learned this week.

The task will to implement part of a payroll system.

The task is split into steps corresponding to tests defined in PayrollTest.cpp

1) Define a SalariedEmployee class in SalariedEmployee.hpp
   / SalariedEmployee.cpp

   A salaried employee has an annual salary. The monthly pay of a salaried
   employee is taxed so they only receive 2/3 of pre-tax pay





Salaried employees - annual pay / 12 and after tax receive 2/3 this amount
