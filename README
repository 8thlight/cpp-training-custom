# C++ training exercises

This repository contains code examples and exercises to accompany the 4 day C++
training course. This course assumes a working knowledge of C.

It is intended that this repo be used as a custom starting point for hosted
version of [cyber-dojo](https://cyber-dojo.org/).

Additional directories OOC and TestDoubles provide example code for a (slightly
obnoxious) object oriented approach in C and use of a Stub in test
respectively.
