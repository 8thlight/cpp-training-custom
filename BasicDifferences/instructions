In this exercise we will look at a few basic features
of C++ that you may not be familiar with from C.

References (references.cpp)
---------------------------

What do you do when you want to pass something to a
function that:

 - would be expensive to take a copy of?
 - you want to modify and see that modification at call point?

In C you would typically reach for a pointer. In C++
it is more typically a reference.

Take a look at references.cpp to get a feel for syntax
and usage.
