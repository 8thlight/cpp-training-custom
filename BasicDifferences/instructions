In this exercise we will look at a few basic features
of C++ that you may not be familiar with from C.

Namespaces (namespaces.cpp)
---------------------------

Time to find out about the "using namespace std" we
saw in the C++ hello world. Namespaces help us prevent
naming conflicts in projects.

See namespaces.cpp for examples.


References (references.cpp)
---------------------------

What do you do when you want to pass something to a
function that:

 - would be expensive to take a copy of?
 - you want to modify and see that modification at call point?

In C you would typically reach for a pointer. In C++
it is more typically a reference.

Take a look at references.cpp to get a feel for syntax
and usage.


Functions (functions.cpp)
-------------------------

What can be different about the humble function I hear
you ask?

Open functions.cpp to find out about function overloading
and default parameters.


Exceptions (exceptions.cpp)
---------------------------

In standard C++ error handling is frequently done with
exceptions. This may not be the case in embedded environments
but we will take a quick look so that you are at least familiar
with the syntax if you see it in the wild.

See exceptions.cpp
