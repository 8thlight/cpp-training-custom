C++ TicTacToe Command-Line Game, optimised for Windows Visual Studio. 

Please ensure to turn off precompiled headers for BOTH projects 
(Project -> Properties -> C/C++ -> Precompiled Headers -> double-click Precompiled Header tab so its value shows "Not Using Precompiled Headers").

To run the game, press play button in Main.

Or use the VS IDE to run the tests at the solution level (tests are included in a separate project under the same solution).
